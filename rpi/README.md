# The RPI Project


## Dependencies
sshpass

spc

ssh

All dependencies should be available via brew/apt.

## Running Project
Feel free to run the project however u like, i have ignored Themake file in the gitignore. Only the initial push will be there so u dont have to use it. The idea behind this setup is that we dont rely on the sd card having the data files. We can freely develop the python project locally and we only send the files over via ssh when we want to test. This should work for both RP Zero and RP W 2. 

If you do want to use the make file, simply change the IP to your RP's IP or hostname and change the login password. Modify and fuck around at your own risk.


# Reminder
Find Out := k * (Fuck around)

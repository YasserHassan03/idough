You can find Raspberry Pi embedded code in the dedicated `rpi` directory.

You can find the dynamic backend/frontend of our user application and the sophisticated bread-related algorithms in the `myproject` directory.

To run the application locally, first install Django, then navigate to the `myproject` directory and run `python3 manage.py runserver`.

Please visit our marketing website [here](https://ya9218.wixsite.com/idough)!

The Django web application runs on an EC2 instance on AWS. The application is fully functional with an error page and an integrated email API, which sends the user an email once the bread is done proving.

Thanks!

Plan-

Yasser -gay marketing website (now) with 2 min promo video (later)

Yazan - React app/website for now (UI) with fake data - AWS? (spec only says for "remote client") consider how to send inputs from react app back to client (for temp control if we get that far)

Omar - Play with temperature/humidity sensor get that to work, if EZ consider transmission and client-server arrangement

James - Look out bread specific stuff (type of bread, target humidity, temp, how these affect rate for prediction) find suitable sensor and test (ultrasound vs TOF) - consider heating element for temperature control.
